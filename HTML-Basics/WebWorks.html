   <p><h3>What's the internet?</h3>  
    The internet is an interconnection of computer networks which allow them to communicate and share resources and information.</p>
    
<div>
       <h3> How the internet works</h3>
    <p>Servers are special computers directly connect to the internet.<br>
    Webpages are files on the server's hard drive.<br>
    Everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet has a special address called IP (Internet protocol) address.<br>
    
    IP address help computers find each other.<br>
    
    Our day-to-day computers are called clients because the are indirectly connected to the internet through an ISP
    (Internet Service Provider ).<br>
    
    When information travels across the internet, computers break them down into smaller pieces called packets.<br>
    When the packets reach their destination the reassemble themselves in the correct order.<br>
    
    Anywhere where two or more parts of the internet intersect there is a router.<br>
    Routers direct packets around the internet.</p></div>

    <p><h3>What is Domain Name?</h3>
    A domain name is the unique, human-friendly address used to access a website on the internet, such as "google.com".
    <h3>What DNS is and how it works?</h3>
    DNS (Domain Name System) is the internet's "phone book" that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into  IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1)
   </p>

   <p><h3>What are browsers and how they work?</h3>
   A browser is an application that allows users to access and view websites on the internet by retrieving files from a webserver and rendering them as a readable webpage.<br>
    It works using a client-server model: the browser acts as the "client" to request information from a web server, which
    then sends the website's content, like HTML files, back to the browser to be displayed. Examples include Chrome,Safari etc.

   <p><h3> What is a Markup language?</h3>
    A markup language is a system that uses tags or codes to annotate and define the structure and presentation of digital documents, such as web pages.<br> Unlike programming languages, it is not executed but is read and rendered by computers to format text, control layout, and provide instructions on how content should be displayed.<br> A key example is HTML, the standard language for creating web pages, which uses tags to tell a browser how to display words, images, and other elements.

   <p><h3>What is Frontend Development?</h3>
   Front-end development is the practice of creating the user-facing parts of websites and applications, focusing on everything a user sees and interacts with in their browser.<br>It involves using for example HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to build the
   layout, design, and functionality of a site.<br> This role ensures a visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive user experience across different devices.

   <p><h3> What is http?</h3>
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a fundamental set of rules that web browsers and servers use to communicate
over the internet.<br> It operates on a request-response basis, where your browser sends an HTTP request to a server,
and the server sends back an HTTP response containing the requested data.<br> This protocol enables the transfer of
files like HTML documents, images, and more, which is how you view web pages.<br>
Though HTTPS is preferred:<br>
HTTP vs. HTTPS: While http:// can be used for many transfers, https:// encrypts the connection, making it a safer choice for sensitive information like credit card details.

</p>


<p><h3>What is  the WWW and how it works?</h3>
    The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interconnected, publicly accessible webpages that run on the Internet.<br> It works
    by using web browsers to request information from web servers, which are computers that store websites. <br>Key technologies
    like HTTP, HTML, and URLs allow the browser to retrieve files, translate the code into a readable webpage, and display
    it to the user.
